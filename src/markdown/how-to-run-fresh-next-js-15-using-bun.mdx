# How to Run Fresh Next.js 15 Using Bun

Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime that offers a great alternative to Node.js, with built-in support for package management and script execution. In this guide, we will set up a fresh Next.js 15 project and run it using Bun.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Install it using `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (Optional, but good for compatibility checks)
- A terminal or command prompt

## Step 1: Create a Fresh Next.js 15 Project

Run the following command to create a new Next.js 15 project:

```sh
bun create next@latest my-next-app
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd my-next-app
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Bun can install dependencies much faster than npm or yarn. Simply run:

```sh
bun install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies for your Next.js 15 project.

## Step 3: Run the Next.js Development Server

To start the Next.js development server using Bun, run:

```sh
bun dev
```

Your Next.js app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 4: Building and Running in Production

To build the project, run:

```sh
bun run build
```

Then, start the production server:

```sh
bun run start
```

# Conclusion

Using Bun with Next.js 15 provides a faster development experience, thanks to Bun's speed and efficient package management. If you're looking to optimize your Next.js workflow, give Bun a try!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
